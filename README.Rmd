# pli

<!-- badges: start -->
[![R build status](https://github.com/illinois-r/pli/workflows/R-CMD-check/badge.svg)](https://github.com/illinois-r/pli)
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of pli is to provide an interface to [PrairieLearn's API endpoints](https://prairielearn.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/).

## Installation

You can install the released version of pli from [GitHub](https://github.com/illinois-r/pli) with:

``` r
if(!requireNamespace("devtools")) { install.packages("devtools") }
devtools::install_githu("illinois-r/pli")
```

## Setup

Prior to using `pli`, you must create a personal access token on PrairieLearn's 
production server.

<https://prairielearn.engr.illinois.edu/pl/settings>

Once on the page, press "(+) Generate New Token". The token will only be displayed
only once. Please make sure to copy the token.

For _R_ to know about the token, please include it in your `.Renviron` file.

Open the `~/.Renviron` file by typing:

```r
usethis::edit_r_environ()
```

Inside the file, add the following line: 

```bash
PRAIRIELEARN_API_TOKEN="<your-token-here>"
```

Subsitute `<your-token-here>` with the token that was generated. (**Note:** Make sure to remove `<>`.)
