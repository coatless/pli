## pli

<!-- badges: start -->
[![R build status](https://github.com/illinois-r/pli/workflows/R-CMD-check/badge.svg)](https://github.com/illinois-r/pli)
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of `pli` is to provide an interface to [PrairieLearn's API endpoints](https://prairielearn.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/). By providing
a bridge to the endpoints, we can quickly import assessment data into _R_
and perform psychometric analyses. Moreover, the data can automatically 
be moved between PrairieLearn and LMS systems that do not yet have an LTI
connection available. ([Looking at you Canvas](https://github.com/PrairieLearn/PrairieLearn/issues/2015).)

### Installation

You can install the released version of `pli` only from
[GitHub](https://github.com/illinois-r/pli) with:

``` r
if(!requireNamespace("devtools")) { install.packages("devtools") }
devtools::install_githu("illinois-r/pli")
```

### Setup

Prior to using `pli`, a personal access token (PAT) must be created
on PrairieLearn's production server.

<https://prairielearn.engr.illinois.edu/pl/settings>

Once on the page, press "(+) Generate New Token." The token will only be 
displayed once. Please make sure to copy the token. For `pli` to know about 
the token, please include it in `~/.Renviron` file as `PRAIRIELEARN_API_TOKEN`.

#### Steps for using the Token in _R_

**First**, open the `~/.Renviron` file by typing in _R_:

```r
usethis::edit_r_environ()
```

**Second**, within the file, add the following line: 

```bash
PRAIRIELEARN_API_TOKEN="<your-token-here>"
```

Subsitute `<your-token-here>` with the token that was generated. (**Note:** Make sure to remove `<>`.) 

**Third**, save the file and restart _R_ for the changes to take effect.

### Endpoints

The package supports downloading data from the following endpoints:

Function  | Description
----------|-------------
`pl_course_gradebook()` | Gradebook
`pl_assessment_list()` | List of all assessments in course
`pl_assessment_view()` | View a single assessment in course
`pl_assessment_instance_list()` | List of all instances underneath a specific assessment
`pl_assessment_instance_view()` | View a single student instances of an assessment
`pl_assessment_submission_list()` | List of all submission underneath a specific assessment
`pl_assessment_submission_view()` | View a single student submission


### Sample workflow

Login in to PrairieLearn and select the course you wish to obtain
information from. The course instance number for this course can be
obtained by looking at the URL for the class:

```
https://prairielearn.engr.illinois.edu/pl/course_instance/54777/instructor/instance_admin/assessments
```

In this case, the course instance number would be `54777`. With this in hand,
let's query the grade book:

```r
library(pli)
course_instance_id = 54777

## Gradebook Manipulations ---- 

# Download the entire gradebook
grades = pl_course_gradebook(course_instance_id)


# Format for a single assessment to Compass2g
library(tidyverse)
grades %>% 
  filter(assessment_id == 1228980) %>%
  select(user_uid, points) %>%
  mutate(
         points = replace_na(points, 0),
         user_uid = gsub("@.*","", user_uid)
        ) %>%
  write_csv("grades-quiz1.csv")

## Specific assessment manipulation ----

# Get an overview of all assessments
assessments = pl_assessment_list(course_instance_id)

# Retrieve scores for that instance
quiz_1 = pl_assessment_instance_list(course_instance_id, 1228980)

# Export to Compass2g
grade_format_compass2g(quiz_1, "quiz1-stat486.csv")
```
